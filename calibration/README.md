## Calibration
Calibration is a crucial part of any type of robotics project, and drones are no different. In order for the camera to get an accurate 3D point, it needs the exact specs of the camera.

This program helps you calibrate your camera!

### Usage
First, to generate the images, run the `capture.py` utility. This will capture .PNG files from your camera.

Simply run the `calibrate.py` file! That will grab every .PNG photo in this directory and will get the camera properties from it.
